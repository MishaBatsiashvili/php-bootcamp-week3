# PHP cocktails project for week 3.

## The project is created using procedural PHP and uses https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.

## Instructions

1. In config.php file's `connect_db` function replace `$servername`, `$username`, `$password` and `$dbname` with the appropriate values.
2. The database is present in `cocktails.sql` file. You should run that file in your database or import it using DB managers like: `phpmyadmin`, `adminer`, `heidisql` and others.
3. To install Tailwind run `npm install` command
4. To start Tailwind run `npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/style.css -o ./build/style.css --watch`. This will monitor the changes in the project and write the generated styles into the `build/style.css` file.
